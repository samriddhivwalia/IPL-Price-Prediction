# IPL-Price-Prediction
A Machine Learning based linear regression model built with an intention to predict playersâ€™ auction price for the Indian Premier League (IPL). The purpose of this model is to establish a relation between auction prices and player attributes.

The price of the players in any sport event is driven by many factors. Given the data consisting of the cricketing attributes of the players, our project identifies the relevant and important features to design a model to efficiently evaluate the auction price of a player. We perform analysis of the factors that influence a player's worth in an IPL auction. It is clear that previous performances influence the player's worth. We extract features which are important for a player and directly affect the final bid.

The goal of the model's construction is to use a linear regression model to forecast player auction prices for the Indian Premier League (IPL). This approach aims to build a link between player traits and auction prices. It is designed to be utilised in future IPL auctions.
